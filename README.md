# Description

This application is designed to showcase my progress as a junior developer as it has links to my GitHub and LinkedIn accounts as well as an html page that highlights three projects I have worked on that I am proud of. The applications I have worked on have screenshots of those applications working and also include links to their corresponding GitHub pages on my profile and links to the deployed application.
